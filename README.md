# Instructions to Run the Program using Docker

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/1-3m-linkedin-jobs-and-skills-2024#:~:text=job_skills.csv(672.72%20MB)) and save the `job_skills.csv` and `linkedin_job_postings.csv` file to the `backend/App` of the cloned repository.
3. Navigate to the root directory of the repository.
4. Run the following command to start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3333/`

***Note:*** Due to the huge size of the csv files that are going to be analyzed on the initial run, docker might take 3-5 minutes to set up.
